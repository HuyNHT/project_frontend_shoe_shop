		<h1> VANS PARTNERS WITH PARISIAN PAINTER INES LONGEVIAL ON CLASSIC FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL COLLABORATION</h1>
		<p>Vans collaborates with acclaimed Parisian Painter, Ines Longevial, as she reimagines Vans Classic footwear and apparel taken from two principle themes, nature and skateboarding. Inspired by her childhood in the countryside, Longevial seamlessly merges her inherent love of Flowers whilst fusing Vans’ Californian skate style. The Vans and Ines Longevial collaboration will hit stores on May 22, 2019. </p>

		<p> Encompassing the Authentic, Era and Slip-On in the collection, each model consists of a unique iteration with specific detailing all featuring flowers with an added customised feel. Similar to the footwear, apparel is injected with light shades of colour and floral prints very reminiscent of Longevial’s iconic paintings. This timeless collection brings a lifestyle approach to the modern day Skater Girl who has no boundaries to what she can wear.</p>

		<center> <img src="Image/Vans50th_Logo_wide.jpg"/> </center>
		<p> Vans is proud to announce the global launch of The Story of Vans on this historic day, Vans’ 50th anniversary. On March 16, 1966 Vans opened in Anaheim, Calif. as a small family-owned brand with big dreams. 50 years later, the Van Doren spirit lives on as one of the largest youth culture brands in the world, fostering a culture of creative expression through action sports, art, music and street culture. Vans commemorates its rich heritage with The Story of Vans series – a visual campaign that is truly the first of its kind – combining a mix of artistic methods to highlight iconic moments from the brand’s 50-year history.</p>
		<p> “It’s an exciting day for Vans as we embark on a new chapter in our history and celebrate 50 ‘Off The Wall’ years of actively supporting and enabling creative expression. We also look to the future as we introduce progressive platforms and product innovation that consumers around the world expect from Vans," said Kevin Bailey, Vans and VF Action Sports President. “The Story of Vans exemplifies the milestones that have made Vans the unique brand it is today and the inventive composition of the campaign allows us to bring those moments to life through an interactive experience at the House of Vans worldwide.”</p>
